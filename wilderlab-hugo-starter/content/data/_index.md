## Best Practices
- **FAIR Data**: findable, accessible, interoperable, reusable
- **Backups**: local + cloud; version control for code & metadata
- **Reproducibility**: notebooks, scripts, and documented workflows

## Protocol Summaries
- Field safety briefing & debriefing
- Lab safety, PPE, and waste disposal
- Device workflows: camera traps, passive acoustics, eDNA, GIS/RS

*Full protocols for lab members are available in our internal Notion.*
